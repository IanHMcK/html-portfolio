<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>About to be retired Electrical Engineer, I have now decided to branch out into web development. Other interests include blacksmithing and woodturning.</p>

<p>I am also in the process of opening up a glamping site in west Wales that will introduce people to our local flora and fauna. We also have an on-site observatory, ideal for the dark nights we experience</p>
